Sometime, we want to generate a QR code image, this code contains some data, such as an URL, ticket number, etc. Then, end user can use Mobile phone to scan this image to get the data.

In Java, we can use an popular library, named Zxing to do this stuff.

**Steps**
1, Add the following dependency into your pom.xml:
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.zxing</groupId>
    <artifactId>core</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
</dependency>
